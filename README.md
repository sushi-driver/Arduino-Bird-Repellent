# Arduino Bird Repellent

Detects bird calls by frequency using FFT and triggers a sound device.

I built this device to deal with a bird I like to call a "fire alarm bird", aka the California towhee. 
This bird sits right outside my bedroom window and emits an ear-piercing call starting at ~5am every morning.
This device repels the bird by listening for its call and triggering a loud "rattle" sound when detected.
